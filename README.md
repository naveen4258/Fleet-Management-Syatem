 Fleet management is an administrative approach that allows companies to organize and coordinate working vehicles. The main aim of the fleet management is to improve efficiency, reduce costs, live monitoring. Fleet management plays a very significant role as it manages the flow of goods along the supply chain and therefore helps in controlling supply chain cost. In this we are providing an interface for the driver to register himself and he can login to his account through his credentials and he can access the dashboard were he can check his time slots for delivery of goods for the assigned vehicle. Here we are providing an web interface for the administrator to keep tracking of the vehicles were the administrator can check the current location of the vehicle and information of the driver assisting the vehicle and his previous records. A new vehicle can be added or removal an existing vehicle from the records can be done by the administrator only. Location of the vehicle can be tracked by using GPS location module and the temperature, ultrasonic, GPRS module etc., some physical parameters   inside the vehicle is calculated  through respective sensors and the sensory values is uploaded to the database through a Wi-Fi module. Fleet management is used by couriers, oil and gas delivery etc., in service industry business to ensure the responsible vehicle use, confirm safety and enable real time tracking.
